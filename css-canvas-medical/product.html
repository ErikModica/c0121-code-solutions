          <h2>It's the foundation for patient-centered primary care.</h2>
          <p>
            Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care across clinicians,
            staff, and patients themselves -- making you more productive, less
            stressed, and adding just a bit more joy into your practice of
            medicine.

        <h2>It puts care at your command</h2>
        <p>
          You don't have to click a dozen times to order a flu shot or bounce around
          five windows to discover the last blood count. Canvas pulls everything
          you need directly into your note, so you never have to leave it.
          And because Canvas learns from every interaction, it gets
          smarter with every patient you see.

          "Canvas works three times as fast, improves performance dramatically
          on key quality metrics, and is incredibly easy to use. The right
          information is presented in the right way at the right time,
          and the product leverages technology to actually improve
          the quality of care I provide."

        <p>
          Canvas makes it simple to search and take action across your entire
          patient panel, so you know who needs extra help and how best to
          give it to them. Easily reach out to any subgroup of your
          population with proactive interventions, and take comfort
          knowing you&apos;re a step ahead.

          "Which of my uncontrolled diabetic patients haven&apos;t had a test
          in the past 3 months? Which of my patients are on potentially
          unsafe levels of opioids according to the most recent
          guidelines? That doesn&apos;t seem like a lot to ask
          and those are tremendously important questions. But
          I just couldn&apos;t get an answer from our old
          system! Canvas light-years ahead."

        <h2>It automates performance improvement</h2>
        <p>
          Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you understand
          performance, but they aren&apos;t enough to improve quality and
          increase revenue day after day. Canvas automates quality
          protocols and charge capture so clinicians can focus on
          more complex work only they can do.

          "With MIPS a reality and fee-for-service billing rules as complex as
          ever, to be honest I didn&apos;t know how we were going to keep up.
            We&apos;re a small practice and we don&apos;t have a big quality
            team or group of coders to catch everything. The automation
            in Canvas has completely eliminated my concerns around
            quality and revenue performance."
